I am creating a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) app, like Zendesk, but simplified. 
I am using Supabase as the primary backend infrastructure.
I will deploy to aws amplify.
I will be using Docker to Develop locally, with the goal of easy, early and often deployment to Vercel.
I am using a combination of Lovable + Cursor for development.
When I need multiple small UIs with a single backend, I will use a centralized edge function repository.
